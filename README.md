# Files
You can download this tutorial from github, the resulting zip file will not have any trajectories from the MD simulations described below due to file size limits.
* Avogadro output: molecule.pdb 
* Minimization script: 01_min.in 
* Constant volume heating script: 02_heat.in
* NPT equilibration script: 03_equil.in
* NPT production script: 04_prod.in

# Instructions
